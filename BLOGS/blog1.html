    <p>
      I never thought learning would move so fast from <em>notebooks</em> to <em>screens</em>. When the pandemic hit during my Grade 10 year,
      I was suddenly pushed into online classes that I wasn’t ready for at all. New tools, unstable internet, and constant
      pressure became part of my daily routine. Looking back now, I realize that this sudden shift completely changed how
      I learn and how I see technology. At first, I felt lost because everything I was used to suddenly disappeared.
      Traditional classrooms were replaced by virtual meetings that felt unfamiliar and confusing. This experience marked
      the beginning of my journey toward adapting to digital learning.

    <h2>Adjusting to Online Learning</h2>
    <small>Challenges and Discoveries</small>
    <p>
      When classes shifted online, everything felt overwhelming and unfamiliar. I did not even own a <strong>laptop</strong> at first because
      I never thought I would need one for school. We had to buy a <strong>laptop</strong> just so I could attend online classes and submit
      requirements. This experience made me realize how dependent education has become on technology, even for students who
      were not prepared for it. One of my biggest struggles was dealing with slow internet and sudden disconnections.
      There were times when I missed discussions or got disconnected during quizzes, which made me anxious and frustrated.
      I also had to learn how to use <em>LMS</em> and <em>Google Classroom</em> on my own. Through this, I learned that technology is only
      helpful when access and connectivity are reliable.

    <h2>Growing Confidence</h2>
    <small>Embracing New Skills</small>
    <p>
      Online learning did not only affect me academically but also emotionally. I felt anxious every time I had to recite
      because opening the microphone and camera felt intimidating. Unlike face-to-face classes, I became more conscious
      knowing that everyone was listening and watching. Over time, I realized that this anxiety pushed me to slowly build
      confidence in expressing myself.

    <h2>Mastering Tools</h2>
    <small>Becoming Tech-Savvy</small>
    <p>
      As time passed, technology started to feel less intimidating and more helpful. <strong>Canva</strong> played a big role in developing
      my creativity and designing skills, especially when making school presentations and projects. Using <em>Google Workspace</em>
      also helped me stay organized with documents, files, and deadlines. These tools showed me that technology can
      enhance learning when used properly and creatively.

    <h2>Looking Back</h2>
    <small>Reflections as an IT Student</small>
    <p>
      Now that I am an IT student at <strong>UE</strong>, I realize how valuable those early experiences were. The adjustment I went
      through during the pandemic helped me adapt more easily to technology in my current field. From pens to keyboards,
      I learned how to fully embrace digital tools that are essential in IT. This made me more confident that I chose the
      right path for my future career. I also became more independent in solving technical problems on my own. Each
      challenge helped me improve my patience and problem-solving skills. These experiences shaped my mindset toward
      continuous learning and improvement.
