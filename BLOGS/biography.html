      I was born on <strong>July 27, 2006</strong> in <strong>Quezon City</strong> at <strong>UERM</strong>. I grew up in a household surrounded by grandparents, aunts, cousins, and pets. My childhood was spent without my OFW parents, but I received constant love and guidance from my extended family. From a young age, I was drawn to <em>makeup</em>, <em>fashion</em>, and creative self-expression. <strong>Barbie dolls</strong> from Divisoria were my favorite toys, and I enjoyed dressing them up and making accessories. I was introverted and preferred spending time alone in my creative space. Academics were not my main interest during my early years, as my grades often ranged from the 70s to early 80s. Receiving a 90 became a memorable achievement for me. I spent much of my childhood doing arts and crafts, sometimes leading to humorous mishaps. One memorable moment was when I cut my own hair before my kindergarten graduation. I also experimented with designing clothes for my dolls using my grandmother’s bedsheets. These experiences helped shape my creativity and emotional resilience.

      I entered my teenage years as a quiet yet approachable individual. I studied at <strong>Sacred Heart of Jesus Catholic School</strong> from Grade 3 to Grade 10. For senior high school, I transferred to <strong>La Consolacion College Manila</strong> under the <em>STEM strand</em>. Despite being introverted, I actively joined the dance club and performed in numerous school events. I led my class in dance competitions and dancing became one of my strongest talents, a skill inherited from my mother. During Grades 11 and 12, I received multiple academic recognitions including <strong>honors</strong>, <strong>high honors</strong>, and <strong>leadership awards</strong>. I was selected as <strong>Best Muse</strong> during Sportsfest 2023 and represented my school in promotional materials. I also served as an officer in the Student Coordinating Body and became active in the <em>Dalisay Dance Troupe</em>.

      I am currently pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</strong> at the <strong>University of the East Manila</strong>. I chose IT to explore a field different from arts and performance. My transition into college was smooth, and I adapted well to the blended learning setup. I appreciate the flexibility of managing my time between online and face-to-face classes. I have consistently performed well academically and am a college scholar with a 50 percent tuition discount. I have been part of the Academic Achievers list since my first year. While I sometimes worry about new instructors, I remain confident in my ability to adapt. My social circle is small but stable, with close friendships that support my academic journey. I prioritize my studies and aim to graduate with honors while continuing my creative pursuits.
